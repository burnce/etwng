Unpacking large esf (especially startpos.esf) can result in over 300MB of xml data,
and that would be very difficult to view or edit, so it's split into multiple files instead.

The root file is always called esf.xml, and binary files currently have hardcoded names.
Everything else is controlled from lib/xml_split.rb, which should be very easy to understand and edit.

=== Rules ===

xml_split.rb contains rules for handling individual records:

  :CAI_WORLD_REGION_SLOTS        => "cai_region_slots/",

This rule means whenever decoder encounters CAI_WORLD_REGION_SLOTS record,
it creates a new file in "cai_region_slots/" directory.

Name can contain various %-codes which will be expanded for saving:

  :CHARACTER_ARRAY               => "character/%f-%s-%d",

%f - current faction
%s - first string within record
%d - four digit sequential number

If pattern would result in file which already exists,
converter appends -0001, -0002 etc. to next files.
So first file is called foo.xml, second foo-0001.xml,
third foo-0002.xml etc.

%d simply forces numbering from first file, so first would be
foo-0001.xml, second foo-0002.xml and so on.

If only directory is given and no file name converter checks
if records starts with a string, and if so appends it as if
pattern was "directory/%s", otherwise it just starts with a number.

If some part of the path is empty converter may delete "-" character
following that part's pattern. For example if faction is "austria",
number is 5, but converter can find no string in record then
"character/%f-%s-%d" pattern will be expanded to "character/austria-0005.xml",
not "character/austria--0005.xml"
